This package is meant to create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to manual 
correct mis-tracking such as swapped labels, and badly labeled body points 
generated by Multi-Animal tracking tools like maDLC or SLEAP.

Hopefully, you would have used [AutoPoseMapper](https://github.com/senakoko/AutoPoseMapper) prior to using this tool. 
AutoPoseMapper should help fix most of the errors created by maDLC and SLEAP.

The GUI was built using [PyQt5](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python) 
so refer to the website if you have any installation issues.

## Installation:
1. Open a terminal
2. Download the repository <code> git clone https://github.com/senakoko/poseCorrection.git </code>
3. Create a new conda environment <code>conda create -n pcg python=3.8 -y </code>
4. Activate desired conda environment <code> conda activate pcg </code>
5. Navigate to unzipped folder containing requirements.txt.  
6. Run   
<code>
pip install -r requirements.txt  
</code>  

## Running the GUI
